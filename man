.TH Man page for the VASP (vienna ab initio Simulations Package) and utilities.

.SH BASIC INPUT FILES

Every VASP calculation must have 4 files: 

.B INCAR
The main control file.

.B POTCAR
The PAW projectors.

.B KPOINTS
The K-points smash in the recíprocal space.

.B POSCAR
The positions of the atoms.

.SH FUNCTIONALS

For using the PBESol approach, set the flag 
.B GGA = PS
in the
.B INCAR 
file and using the PBE PAW projectors.

.SH STRESS TENSOR CALCULATIONS (ST)

Set the cutoff energy to 
.B ENCUT = 1.5 * ENMAX

copy the 
.B CONTCAR 
file the the 
.B POSCAR
file until the calculation realize only 1 iônic step

.SH OPTIMIZATION CALCULATION (NO ST)

Set the Cutoff energy to 
.B ENCUT = 1.125 * ENMAX


.SH DENSITY OF STATE CALCULATIONS (DOS)

.TP
In the 
.B INCAR 
File set change the following variables: NSW = 0; SIGMA = 0.01; ISMEAR = 0; NEDOS = 6001; ENCUT = 1.125 * ENMAX; LORBIT = 10; NBANDS = NELECT (Relaxation), IBRION=-1, ISIF=0, LVHAR=.TRUE. 

.TP
In the 
.B KPOINTS 
File duplicate the number of K-Points


.SH BANDS CALCULATIONS (BANDS)

.TP 
.B First Execution:

In the 
.B INCAR 
file set the following variables:
ENCUT = 1.125 * ENMAX; NSW = 0; LCHARGE = .TRUE.; NBANDS = NELECT (Relaxation). 

.TP
.B Secund Execution:

In the 
.B INCAR
file set the following variables: NBANDS = NELECT (Relaxation); LCHARG = .FALSE.; copy 
.B CHGCAR
from the last step; ICHARG = 11; LORBIT = 10

In the 
.B KPOINS 
file set the path desiable for the system, e.g. K-gamma-M-K.


.SH WORK FUNCTION

The For the work function calculation, in the 
.B INCAR 
file, change the variable LVHAR = .TRUE. and no update the atoms position. Are recomended done this calculation togheter with DOS calculations 

The work function can be calculated using: wf = Vvac - EFermi. where Vvac are the vacum potential from the Hartree potential curve and EFermi can be colected using: 'grep "fermi" OUTCAR'. Is requiered to colect the fermi level from Relaxation (DOS) simulation.


.SH CHARGE DENSITY and CHARGE DIFERENCE

The flag LCHARG = .TRUE. writes the charge density of the system. Are importante set NSW = 0 to no update the atomic positions.  

For the charge density diference, plot the charge density of eache individual subsystem, keep the positions and change the 
.B POTCAR 
file accoding the the chemical species.

.SH CALCULATION WITH SOC (Spin Orbit Couplig)

For SOC calculation, change the folow variables: LSORBIT=.True., NBANDS = 2* NELECT and using the 
.B vasp_ncl 
binary

.SH HYBRID FUNCTIONALS (HSE06)
For HSE06 calculation, add the following variables in the INCAR file: 
LHFCALC = .TRUE., AEXX = 0.25, HFSCREEN = 0.207


.SH BADER charge Analisys
Add the folowing variable in the 
.B INCAR 
file: LAECHG=.TRUE
The other evaluations follow the website: http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/
